NAME
    Finance::FITF - Fast Intraday Transaction Format

SYNOPSIS
      use Finance::FITF;

      my $day = Finance::FITF->new_from_file('XTAF.TX-2010-11-19.fitf');
      $day->header->{start}[0]; # start of the first session
      $day->header->{end}[0];   # end of the first session

      $day->header->{bar_seconds}; # number of seconds per bar

      # last bar in the file. you can get open/high/low/close/volume from $bar
      my $bar = $day->bar_at($day->header->{end}[0]);

      # run the ticks in the last bar with the given callback
      $day->run_ticks($bar->{index}, $bar->{index}+$bar->{ticks}-1,
                      sub { my ($time, $price, $volume) = @_; });

DESCRIPTION
    Finance::FITF provides access to the FITF format, an efficient storage
    format for intraday trading records.

FORMAT
    The FITF format consists 3 parts:

    header
        The header defines the name, date, and sessions of the transactions
        that the file is describing.

    bars
        The number of bars in the file is determined by the total seconds in
        the sessions defined in the header, divided by "bar_seconds" defined
        in the header. The first bar denotes trading transaction between the
        start of the session, until and excluding "bar_seconds" past the
        start of the session.

        Each bar contains the "open", "high", "low", and "close" prices
        information of the given period, as well as "volume" and "ticks".

        The "index" field points to the start of the tick records of the
        period of the current bar.

    ticks
        The number of ticks in the file is determined by the "records" field
        in the header. Each record contains "price" and "volume" for the
        transaction. The time of the transaction is determined by
        "offset_min" and "offset_msec", which are time offset in minutes and
        milliseconds from the start of the *first session*, respectively.
